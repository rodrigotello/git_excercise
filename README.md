# Git Excercise
This is a Git Excercise for noobs.

### Intro
The purpose of this excercise is set up the basic instructions to collaborate on a work

### Steps
This steps would be written as I tried.

First Machine:
1. Crete a folder named "git_excercise". This would be the local folder for the excercise.
2. Create a file called index.html inside our folder, with just one line of code. For example: "Hello world"
3. Create a repository on GitHub called git_excercise
4. Initialize the Git inside the folder
5. Make a commit
6. Make the first push to GitHub
** Commit and push successfull! **
7. Add the other user (Second Machine) as a Collaborator in GitHub

Second Machine:
8. Clone the Git from GitHub with this command:
$ git clone https://github.com/rodrigotello/git_excercise.git

First Machine:
9. Create a branch for Staging and Back-End

#### Note: If you change from branch to branch without commiting, you lose whatever you've been working on
